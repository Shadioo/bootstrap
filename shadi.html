Web content has been identified as one of the main factors contributing to repeat visits. As content on the web includes text, pictures,
graphics, layout, sound, motion and, someday, even smell, making the right web content decisions are critical to effective web design. While
an understanding of marketing strategies that attract visitors to websites is beginning to emerge, how to convert web surfers to repeat visitors
is a less well-understood phenomenon. Through an empirical study, the authors develop the Website Preference Scale (WSPS) based upon the
work in environmental psychology of Rachel Kaplan and Stephen Kaplan. The results identify underlying dimensions of effective website
design and provide insight into site design characteristics, which may lead to a higher likelihood of revisit.

<br> Introduction <br>
By whatever measure used, the web is big. The majority
of American homes now have computers, 64% of Americans age 12 or older have used the Internet in the past year
(CyberAtlas, 2000), and retail sales are projected to reach
US$74 billion by 2002 (Forrester Research, 2001). It is,
then, no small wonder that most companies feel that they
need at least some level of web presence today. The
question facing all companies contemplating web initiatives
is how to build a successful website.
Amazon has raised and spent millions of dollars on
building and maintaining their site, and creating the Amazon brand. During its heyday, Amazon’s valuation was
attributed, at least in part, to its ability to capture and hold
their customers’ attention. As a result, many e-retailers
adopted the Amazon web design format when developing
their own sites.
By contrast, traditional retailers going online provide an
alternative to the Amazon model. Their tendency is to
transfer what works in the brick-and-mortar world to the
Internet. However, even the seasoned retailers (e.g., Disney)
are finding it difficult to create the right formula to succeed
online (Couzin, 2000).
With the increasing number of companies taking advantage of the Internet, it is important to understand what drives
utilization of one site over another. A recent study by
Forrester Research indicates that high-quality content, ease
of use, speed and frequency of updating are the top four
factors contributing to repeat visits (Numbers, 1999). Yet,
another study of 50 shopping sites run by US and UK retailers
indicated a failure to satisfy the customer’s shopping experience on at least some of these dimensions (Kane, 1999).
While an understanding of marketing strategies that
attract visitors to websites is beginning to emerge (e.g.,
Schwartz, 1996), how to convert web surfers to repeat
visitors through effective web design is a less well-understood phenomenon. Practitioners’ advice on site design and
content abound and is often conflicting. The research
presented in this paper suggests that one way to assist in
the development of effective web designs is to examine the
web from the perspective of cognitive psychology.
The work of environmental psychologists, Rachel
Kaplan and Stephen Kaplan, provides a means of understanding how to facilitate the interactive experience through
the concept of a cognitive environment. Kaplan and Kaplan
view environments as providing information in many
ways—through signs, icons, with or without words. Their
studies apply cognitive psychology to the design of physicallandscapes. Through their research, they have found that
informational needs influence preferences for certain landscapes. People both want to make sense of and get involved
in their landscapes. By utilizing principles from cognitive
psychology, Kaplan and Kaplan have demonstrated that it is
possible to develop landscapes, which facilitate sense making and involvement.
In many ways, designing effective web content is very
similar to designing a physical landscape. Computer interaction is intensely cognitive involving perceptions and
preferences. Interactivity implies not only perceiving the
web landscape, but also entering into it and ‘‘experiencing’’
the space.
In an attempt to develop a better understanding of what
constitutes high-quality web content (i.e., design which
facilitates revisit and purchase), the authors propose the
Website Preference Scale (WSPS) as a way to assess effective web design based on the perspective that a website is a
cognitive landscape. After a brief discussion of web content,
Kaplan and Kaplan’s application of cognitive psychology to
physical landscapes (the Preference Framework) is presented. The Preference Framework is then extended to the
web environment. An exploratory study designed to develop
the WSPS is then presented. Finally, conclusions and a future
program of research are discussed.
to the web. For example, when designing ads for a newspaper, one has a large canvas to work with which lends itself
to striking, intricate designs. Yet, newspaper layout does not
transfer to the web as a computer screen cannot handle the
same volume of information effectively (Nielsen, 1999).
Consequently, simplicity of design has become the mantra
of some web design gurus.
Many elements of design and graphic art can be used to
convey content on the web. The choices are truly endless.
Elements of space, use of images, size of images, use of
animation and/or audio, number of words per line, color and
size of characters are among just a few of these factors.
Additionally, the work of content design does not stop with
selecting the appropriate elements for the particular audience. Content design also involves deciding on the placement of those elements to facilitate their use. The Preference
Framework of Kaplan and Kaplan (1982) and Kaplan et al.
(1998) provides a means of sorting out these many options
and designing an effective web landscape.</h4>
